A piece about Wood Lane, London W12

## What I Did
On October 18th 2016, I visited Wood Lane by travelling to White City Tube station.  I'd been through there the weekend before on the bus and had noticed how the area was changing, being changed, being redeveloped.  I knew it as the home of BBC TV Centre, but that is not being used for it's former purpose and is being transformed within a coccoon of hoardings, behind a fence of advertising.

I shot the video clips here at various points that attracted me in the street.  I had no idea of narrative structure, I was simply sampling from the space.  When I'd finished, I walked through the Westfield shopping centre and bought myself a picnic lunch at Waitrose, some German sausage and some tomatoes.  I sat outside the mall and ate while I watched people wander past.

Then I walked around to a coffee shop on Shepherd's Bush Green, ordered a black filter coffee and looked for a power outlet for my now dead phone.  None were available.  So I sat at the back of the shop, took out my small notebook and pen and started to write.  The script you see here is, more or less, what I wrote then.  I lightly edited it when I typed it up.

## What I Want
My hope is that you will create your own forks of this project to create new works.  It is an experiment for me both in creative collaboration and in the use of git and github for such a project.  My intention is both to create interesting works and to learn how well this technology, which facilitates creative collaboration in the field of programming, works in the field of media-making.

I feel I should point out that I don't need you to stick to film-making, please use this material to inspire whatever work you're attracted to, all I ask is that you use the open source tradition of forking to help show how your work is related to mine.

## Licensing
All media and text files in this repository are released under a CC-BY license.  My understanding of that is that I allow you to re-use and re-mix these files for any purpose as long as you credit me in the resulting work and on any web page that displays or shares that work.  That's what I want to achieve, please let me know if you find the licence unduly restrictive.

Thank you
